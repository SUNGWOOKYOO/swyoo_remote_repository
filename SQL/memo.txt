3.Implementation Stage




E-R Data model 
1. Entities 
2. Attributes 
3. Relationships   

[entities]
entity class vs entity instance 
 = blueprint		= a house 

[attributes]
key ; to find an instance
non-key ; t   o catagorize some instances  

[Relationships]
several types
	- degree1 : unary;  related to itself recursively 
	- degree2 : binary; related to another
		one to one 
		one to many ; ex) employee - department 
		many to many; this is implemented through ternary relationships  
	- degree3 : ternary; invloved in 3 entities 

relationship two cardinality 
maximum cardinality             vs minimum cardinality 
 = max num of entity instances 		= must participate in the relationship 


strong entity 	vs weak entity
= exist itself		= cannot exist without another entity 
ex) customer ; strong entity 
    order ; weak entity 

[weak entity]
ID dependent ; identifier is linked to anoter entitiy(parent entity) 


*** implemetation of relationships

[1 to 1]
which table receives foreign key ? 
if both side of the relationship is optional, it doesn't matter.
If one side of the relationship is optional, the optional side receives the foreign key.

[1 to N]
 The 1 side of the table as a parent, the other side(N) of the table as a child.
the foreign key reside at the many end of the relationship.

[N to M]
we need to create intersection table by using composite key, 
	where composite keys are comprised of the primary key from each of the parent tables.
=> join three table together 
	where we can make association relationship by assigning additional attributes in the intersection table.
associative entity 
	If we use composite key from primary keys and foreign keys,
	=> allowed to rate each product only one time.

	if we use surrogate key,  that is, disaperating foreign keys with primary key.
	=>  allowed too rate each product many times.

[recursive relationship]
when we implement 1 to 1, and 1 to N relationship, using foreign key link between the tables is simple.
1 to 1		=> give same table different alias. ex) PERSON1 AS A, PERSON1 AS B
1 to many 	=> ''
However, when we implement M to N, we need to create an intersection table.

concurrency control, security & backup, recovery

object relational databases!


1. Concurrency control

Need for Atomic Operation : database transaction is operated through several operation. 
	These operations are atomic called LUW and LUW must be successfully completed.
	otherwise, a rollback is performed.


Without an intelligent concurrent processing strategy in place, a possibility exist 
	called a lost update problem.  

* 3 issues(granularity)

	1. Dirty reads ; the transaction reads a modified record that has not yet been committed to the DB.
	2. Inconsistent reads ; re-reads a data set and finds that the data have been changed. 
	3. Phantom reads ; re-reads a data set and finds that a new record has been added. 

[>> solution]
[Resource Locking]; disallowing transactions from reading, updating, and writing till usaging is finished.

Locks - waiting temporarily
1. implicit locks	; be issued by automatically
2. explicit locks	; be issued by users 
	where serializable transaction

However, the new problem happen! 
	=> 'Deadlock' phenomenon ; indefinitely lock because being locked by another user.

[>> solution2]
1. Optimistic Locking
	; it is suitable when the majority of the transactions involve just reading data.
		Many select, 
		Few insert, update, delete
	- First of all, read data and  hen, commit and look for conflict!
		if conflict exists, rollback! 

2. Pessimistic Locking
	; it is suitable when the data are frequently updated. 
		Many insert, 
		Few update, or delete
	- First of all, lock required resources and then, read and commit, and finally release locks. 


Consistent Transaction (ACID, Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable)
	Atomic - each step must be sucessful for the transaction   
	Consistent - no other transactions are disallowed when the transaction is under way.
	Isolated - defining isolation 4 levels
			READ uncommitted, READ committed, Reapeatable READ, Serializable
			---------more isolated ------------------------------------>
	Duralbe - all commited changes are permanent


[Cursors statement]: 
	DECLARE CURSOR LargePurchases As
		SELECT * 
		FROM Sale
		WEHRE purchasePrice >= 10000;


2 types of Cursors 
	1. Forward-only cursors; we cannt scroll the cursor backwards
					any changes by another user would not be visiable
						based on before and after examination 
	2. Scrollable cursors; move forward and backward through the result set to examine the rows
		3 types	
		1. Static cursors
			snapshot of the result is taken and stored in a temporary table.
			and at that point in time, another users are changing the underlying values
			- disadvantage; changes which are made to the underlying data cannot be invisible.
			- advatages; simple, comparatively few resources on the database server.
		2. Keyset cursors
			fetching the result set and stored those primary key values into a temp table.
			- advantage; updates after the cursor was opened are visible.
			- disadvantage; cannot see inserted rows
		3. Dynamic cursors
			oposite of static cursor
			All changes made to the rows in the result are visible while scorlling 


[Database Security] - need Authentication 

Processing right define:
1. who is permitted to perform which actions
2. when certain actions are allowed to be performed 

Run a firewall! 


[Backup and Recovery]
Reprocessing - restore the lastest backup copy. 
	; manually 
Rollback and Rollforward - log file which log all of the activities. 
	rollback - 	undo a transaction straightforwardly
			redo a transaction through log images.
	rollfoward   

[Object-Relational Database Management]


#####################
LECTURE 7 - DATABASE Indexes
####################

improve query performance 

ex) alphabetical order sort => binary search can be used (divide & conquer tech)
	: we can reduce average search time into log2(n) - 1
		and maximum search time into log2(n) 
		

[Index Concepts]
	many different indexs exist in one or more columns in a table.
	trade off : additional storage space requirements
			to estimate the storage space requirements, 
				# of rows in table is multiplied by Average # of bytes required per row 


[B-Tree Index]
B - Tree is a balanced tree.

[Clustered Indexes vs Nonclustered Indexes]
ex) Nonclustered Indexes is a heap 
	disadvantage:
	 Nonclustered Indexes are slower than clustered indexes 
	because the DBMS must follow a pointer to retrieve the actual data row.
	advantage:
	 each table can have more than one nonclustered index 
	 and nonclustered index can optionally contain values from non-indexed columns.
	 
[Bitmap Index]
using 2 axis, they assign each cell to a bit value which indicates association with a value of the other attribute.
	work best when one or both of the attributes has only a small number of unique values.
	Also, require only 25% of the disk space and can be 10 times faster than a tree-based index.

[Hashed Index]
 it can be used in a parallel processing or distributed database environment.

LECTURE 8 - DATA Warehouses, BI systems
####################
 Data Warehouses : (Operational Databases, other internal Data, External Data) ETL system crosses 
 
[Problem]
Dirty data, Missing Values, Inconsistent Data, Nonintegrated Data, Incorrect Format, Too Much Data(parsimony)

ETL process : Extract, Transform, Load 

[Dimensional Database]
Normalized Operational Database vs		 Non-Normalized Operational Database
- Fast data storage, slow data retrieval 	  - Slow data storage, fast data retrieval 

Therefore, Non-Normalized Operational Database is efficient to extract granular datas 
=> Star Schema 


[OLAP and Data Mining]
two catagories of BI application 
1. reporting applications
2. Data mininning applications

Online Analytical Processing(OLAP) is a technique that supports these reporting applications.
	In real time, OLAP uses simple arithmatic functions such as Sum, Average, and so on.
Data Mining is a mathematically sophisticated technique for analyzing database data.

[Data Mining Applications - popular techniques]
1.cluster analysis
2.decision tree analysis 
3.regression
4.Neural Networks
5.Market Basket Analysis

Cassandra = keyspace 
 # columns is different 
 formal key does not exist 
 
 [The MapReduce Process]
 programming model that relies on parallelization to perform data processing on huge datasets.
 	master nodes and worker nodes
two steps
1. The Map step - devides the problem into a series of sub-problems
2. The Reduced step - after completing the tasks, and then worker nodes pass their results back to the master node.
